Today I learned how to create favicons using [**GIMP**](https://www.gimp.org/). I have used GIMP for about two decades and find it to be a great free and open source alternative to Adobe Photoshop. In creating my first favicon I tried to keep it simple so it would show up clearly in different environments. This took a lot of trial and error as I adjusted different fonts and other settings. Once I created an image I was happy with I used a [**favicon generator**](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). I found this generator to be easy to use and was able to replace all of the previous favicons with my image and update the meta.tsx file appropriately.

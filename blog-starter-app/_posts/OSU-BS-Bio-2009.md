After graduating from high school I knew I wanted to pursue an education in science. At first I thought I might want to become a medical doctor, but I then decided that I would rather pursue biology and eventually become a research scientist. I entered Oregon State University as an honors student in 2005 and graduated with my Honors Bachelor of Science in Biology in 2009. In addition to my biology major, I also minored in chemistry and psychology. As part of the honors college I completed my undergraduate thesis about the numerical effects on timing system pathways. Throughout my degree I also worked in two different laboratories as a research assistant and in a third laboratory as a data analyst. In all of my positions I performed experiements, analysed data, and mentored other undergraduate students.

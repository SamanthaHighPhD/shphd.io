I spent some time learning computer science through Udacity and doing side projects on my own and decided that I wanted to pursue a formal computer science education. I decided to return to Oregon State University for my education because they have an accredited and robust computer science program. For those that already have a BS or higher degree in another discipline, Oregon State offers an online postbaccalaureate track to obtaining a Bachelors of Science in computer science. The postbaccalaureate includes all of the necessary computer science courses without the baccalaureate core classes which would have already been completed with a previous degree. I look forward to starting my classes and continuing my education journey.

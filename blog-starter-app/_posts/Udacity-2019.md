After gaining my Ph.D. in Biology and travelling around the world I decided to learn more about computer science through a Udacity Course. I earned the Intro to Programming Nanodegree from Udacity in 2019. 

## Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree Topics

Through this degree I learned: 

- How to make a web page using of HTML and CSS.
- How to code a quiz using Python.
- How to create a movie trailer website using Python, Twilio API, HTML, CSS, and the Turtle graphics module.
- How to perform data analytics using Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, and Pandas.

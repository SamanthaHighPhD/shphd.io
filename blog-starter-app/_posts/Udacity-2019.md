After gaining my Ph.D. in Biology and traveling around the world I decided to learn more about computer science through a Udacity Course. I earned the Intro to Programming Nanodegree from Udacity in 2019. 

## Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree Topics

Through this degree I learned:

- 2- How to code a quiz using Python.
- 3- How to create a movie trailer website using Python, Twilio API, HTML, CSS, and the Turtle graphics module.
- 4- How to perform data analytics using Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, and Pandas.

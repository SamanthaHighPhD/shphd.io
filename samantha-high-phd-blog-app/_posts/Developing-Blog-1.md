I have decided to officially start my own personal website, which will have a blog where I write up projects I am working on and will have links to relevant professional websites such as LinkedIn and GitHub. I will import old blog posts as well. To develop this website I am using and learning more about [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/), [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/), and [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/). Since I already have experience with JavaScript, Node, React, CSS, and HTML, developing with Next.js, Vercel, and Tailwind CSS was relatively straightforward. I developed this website in a Windows environment using Visual Studio Code, which has some helpful extensions. 

## Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that allows developers to create full-stack web applications. Currently Next.js requires Node.js 16.8 or later, which was easy to confirm on windows using the node -v command. Next.js has a logical project structure and is very well documented. I could have installed Next.js using their installation documentation, but because I knew I wanted to build and host my website with Vercel I decided to use their installation documentation, which was specifically related to the template I wanted to try out. 

## Vercel

Vercel is a platform that works in conjunction with Next.js to build and host websites. Vercel has multiple available templates available on GitHub. At first I investigated the [**blog template**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog), but finally decided to use the [**blog-starter template**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter). My decision was effected by the way each blog template utlized themeing. In the blog template the theme was not well documented, at least at the time of writing. The blog-starter template, however, uses Tailwind CSS, which is well documented and looked like it would be really fun to learn.  

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a framework that allows for developer-friendly web design. Learning how to format with Tailwind CSS has been relatively easy so far as it is well documented and Visual Studio code has a very helpful extension called [**Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss), which I am using.

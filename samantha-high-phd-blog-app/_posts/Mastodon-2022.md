Together with my husband, I embarked on the endeavor of setting up a cloud-hosted Mastodon Server, [**pdx.sh**](https://pdx.sh/), demonstrating not only my technical prowess and commitment to seamless operations but also our collaborative spirit and ability to work effectively as a team. By carefully configuring and maintaining the infrastructure, moderating user activities, and troubleshooting issues within Cloudflare and Google Cloud platforms, we ensured a smooth user experience. Leveraging Grafana Cloud, we effectively monitored and identified potential infrastructure issues, proactively addressing them to uphold optimal performance. With a meticulous approach to infrastructure administration and operation, I am equipped to contribute to the smooth and efficient functioning of cloud-based systems and provide reliable solutions to any challenges that may arise.

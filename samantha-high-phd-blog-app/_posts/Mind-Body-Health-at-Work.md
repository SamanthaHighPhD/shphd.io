In my journey through life, I have always recognized the significance of maintaining a healthy mind and body. Whether it was through participating in school sports or engaging in regular exercise in my off time, I understood the transformative impact of an active lifestyle. During my time as a scientist I was able to live an active lifestyle both at work through actively participating in benchwork and in my free time by training for half marathons. As I transitioned into the world of software engineering, I encountered a new set of challenges, realizing the importance of incorporating physical activity into my routine. In this blog post, I want to emphasize the value of active living and explore ways in which companies can support their employees' well-being, fostering a positive and vibrant work environment.

### Balancing Sedentary Work with Active Living 

As my focus shifted towards software engineering projects at Oregon State University and personal endeavors, I noticed a change in my daily routine. The nature of computer-based work often led to longer periods of sitting, inadvertently contributing to a more sedentary lifestyle. With the onset of the pandemic, this trend became even more prevalent. Acknowledging the well-documented benefits of an active lifestyle, I became determined to find ways to counterbalance the effects of sedentary work.

### Taking Steps Towards Active Living 

Recognizing the need to infuse movement into my day, I adopted several strategies. First, I started setting timers to remind myself to stand up and take short walks every 30-60 minutes during the workday, as supported through [**research findings**](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.00599.2020). These breaks not only reinvigorated my body but also refreshed my mind, enhancing my overall productivity. Additionally, I committed to walking at least 3 miles every other day, gradually increasing my endurance and stamina. Remembering the joy of running half marathons in the past, I aspire to return to that level of physical fitness once again.

### Company Support for Employee Well-being

Companies have a tremendous opportunity to prioritize the well-being of their employees by implementing initiatives that promote physical activity. One effective approach is to provide online exercise programs accessible throughout the workday. Encouraging employees to take regular breaks and participate in these programs can yield significant positive effects on their quality of life. [**Research**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8910608/) supports the notion that such interventions lead to increased employee satisfaction and overall well-being.

### Creating a Vibrant Work Environment 

By fostering an environment that values and supports active living, companies can reap numerous benefits. Physical activity enhances cognitive function, creativity, and problem-solving skills, leading to improved productivity and engagement among employees. Moreover, an emphasis on well-being cultivates a positive company culture, fostering camaraderie, and boosting morale.

The significance of mind and body health cannot be overstated, especially in a world where sedentary work has become increasingly prevalent. As I navigate my software engineering journey, I am mindful of the need to prioritize an active lifestyle. Through incorporating simple strategies such as setting timers and committing to regular walks, I am taking proactive steps towards ensuring my well-being. I encourage companies to follow suit, recognizing the immense benefits of supporting their employees' physical activity. By providing online exercise programs and promoting a vibrant work environment, companies can enhance employee satisfaction, productivity, and overall quality of life. Remember, the journey towards a healthier lifestyle begins with small steps. Let's collectively embrace the power of mind and body health, fostering a culture of well-being and vitality in both our personal and professional lives.

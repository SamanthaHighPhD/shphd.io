Upon graduating from high school, my passion for science led me on a transformative educational journey. Initially considering a career in medicine, my aspirations shifted towards biology and a desire to become a research scientist. In 2005, I embarked on my academic path as an honors student at Oregon State University, culminating in the successful attainment of my Honors Bachelor of Science in Biology in 2009. Complementing my major, I also pursued minors in chemistry and psychology, expanding my interdisciplinary knowledge base. As a member of the honors college, I dedicated myself to completing an undergraduate thesis focused on the numerical effects on timing system pathways, delving deep into the intricacies of my field. Concurrently, I gained invaluable research experience by working as a research assistant in two different laboratories and as a data analyst in a third, engaging in hands-on experimental design and implementation, data analysis, and providing mentorship to fellow undergraduate students. These multifaceted experiences have nurtured my scientific acumen, honed my analytical skills, and fostered a strong foundation for my future pursuits as a research scientist.

After immersing myself in the world of computer science through Udacity and personal side projects, I realized the importance of pursuing a formal education to deepen my knowledge and skills in this dynamic field. With this realization, I made the decision to return to Oregon State University. Oregon State University stood out to me as an ideal institution due to its accredited and highly regarded computer science program. Their comprehensive curriculum covers a wide range of courses, ensuring graduates are well-prepared to tackle real-world challenges in the field. What particularly attracted me was their online postbaccalaureate track, designed for individuals who already hold a bachelor's degree in another discipline. This specialized track focuses solely on the core computer science courses, excluding the baccalaureate core classes that were already completed during previous studies. This streamlined approach allows me to expedite my journey towards obtaining a Bachelor of Science in computer science. I look forward to the educational journey that lies ahead. I am ready to immerse myself in a stimulating learning environment, collaborate with talented peers, and gain practical experience that complements my theoretical knowledge. Through this educational endeavor, I aim to acquire a comprehensive skill set encompassing programming languages, algorithms, data structures, software development methodologies, and more. I am confident that the education I receive at Oregon State University will equip me with the expertise and confidence to tackle complex challenges and contribute meaningfully to the field of computer science.

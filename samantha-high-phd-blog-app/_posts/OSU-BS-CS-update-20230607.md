My pursuit of a post-baccalaureate degree in computer science at Oregon State University has been instrumental in refining my skill set and expanding my expertise across multiple programming languages and projects. Throughout this blog post, I will outline the diverse range of skills I have acquired, as well as the hands-on experience gained during my post-baccalaureate studies.

### Skills and Project Experience
During my time at Oregon State University, I engaged in a wide array of projects, allowing me to explore different facets of computer science. These projects involved building websites, constructing and integrating microservices, creating captivating graphical scenes and animations, harnessing the power of parallel programming for data analysis using both CPUs and GPUs, developing and managing databases for a fictional store's inventory, and even crafting fully playable video games. This broad exposure to various project types has equipped me with a versatile skill set and an ability to tackle diverse challenges.

### Business Skills
Alongside technical expertise, I developed proficiency in several business-oriented skills that contribute to effective collaboration and project management. I gained hands-on experience in Agile methodologies, enabling me to thrive in fast-paced and dynamic team environments. Furthermore, my familiarity with Atlassian Jira, a popular project management tool, enhances my ability to streamline workflow and facilitate efficient communication. Additionally, I possess a comprehensive understanding of the Microsoft suite, empowering me to leverage various productivity tools to maximize efficiency and output.

### Languages and Frameworks
Throughout my post-baccalaureate degree program, I mastered multiple programming languages and frameworks that serve as the foundation for my technical prowess. Proficiency in Python, accompanied by powerful libraries, has allowed me to create a variety of programs including playable games. Meanwhile, my expertise in JavaScript, including React and NodeJS, has facilitated the development of responsive and interactive web applications. I have also gained competence in essential web technologies such as HTML and CSS, which are fundamental to creating captivating user interfaces. Furthermore, my knowledge of C, C++, and associated tools such as OpenMP, OpenCL, OpenGL, CUDA, and MPI has enabled me to implement high-performance computing solutions and exploit the full potential of parallel programming. Lastly, I have honed my skills in x86 Assembly, Bash, and PowerShell, further enhancing my ability to tackle low-level programming tasks with precision.

### Tools
As a result of my post-baccalaureate journey, I have become adept at utilizing an array of development tools that streamline the software development process. My proficiency in Git and GitHub allows for effective version control, collaboration, and code management. Additionally, I am experienced in using PyCharm and Visual Studio, powerful integrated development environments (IDEs) that enhance code productivity and organization. Moreover, I am well-versed in utilizing Vim, a versatile and customizable text editor, for efficient code editing. Finally, I have also gained experience with LaTeX, a typesetting system widely used for creating professional-looking documents and reports.

### Database
Understanding the importance of data management, I have acquired expertise in working with databases. I am proficient in utilizing MongoDB, MariaDB, and MySQL, enabling me to design, implement, and manage databases efficiently. This skill set ensures effective storage, retrieval, and manipulation of critical data, crucial for building robust and scalable applications.

### Operations
Complementing my technical skills, I possess a strong background in Linux, a popular operating system within the computer science community. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with GitHub CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment), a set of practices that automate the software build and deployment process. This familiarity allows me to maintain a reliable and efficient software development lifecycle.

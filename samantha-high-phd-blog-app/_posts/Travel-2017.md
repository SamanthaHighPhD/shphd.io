After gaining my Ph.D. in Biology I decided to take a gap year and travel around the world with my husband. We decided to travel flexibly without knowing where our next destination would be, which cultivated my problem-solving skills, adaptability, independence, and self-reliance. In the end we traveled to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Australia, Northern Ireland, Germany, and the Netherlands. Traveling to these diverse countries exposed me to different cultures, customs, and ways of life, which helped develop my cultural adaptability and fostered my global mindset. I had the opportunity to learn and practice foreign languages, engage with locals, navigate through unfamiliar environments, and immerse myself in diverse communities, which developed my ability to connect, listen, and communicate more effectively and diplomatically. Experiencing all of these different cultures and traditions also allowed me to grow creatively while being exposed to new ideas and innovative approaches to various aspects of life.

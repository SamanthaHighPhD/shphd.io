After graduating with my BS in Biology, I decided to pursue higher education and enrolled in the doctoral program at the University of Oregon. I started my research rotations early in June 2010 and classes officially started in September 2010. Throughout my time at University of Oregon my classwork related to neuroscience and the majority of my research related to molecular biology. I worked on mouse model organisms, zebrafish model organisms, and cell lines. I also taught three undergrad laboratory/discussion sections from 2010 to 2011. 

## Doctoral Researcher

As a doctoral researcher I designed experiments, performed statistical analysis of complex experimental data and genome analysis in R (specifically G-test of genotypes) while working with our bioinformatician, wrote my dissertation and papers, presented at meetings and conferences, and collaborated with researchers. I also mentored one to three undergraduate researchers weekly by teaching SOPs and verifying results. My doctoral research focused on the zebrafish model organism - specifically trying to investigate zebrafish sex determination, female sex development, and reproductive duct formation. I defended and graduated with my Ph.D. in June 2016 and continued to complete my research and publications until August 2016.

## Graduate Teaching Fellow

As a graduate teaching fellow I taught the laboratory section of BI 211: General Biology I: Cells, the laboratory section of BI 212: General Biology II: Organisms, and the discussion section of BI 122: Human Genetics. I enjoyed teaching undergraduate students and helping them learn complex topics.
